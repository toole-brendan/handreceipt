    async fn validate_block(&self, block: &Block) -> Result<bool>;
    async fn achieve_consensus(&self, block: &Block) -> Result<ConsensusResult>;
}

// Required merkle verification:
pub trait MerkleVerification {
    fn build_merkle_tree(&self, transactions: &[Transaction]) -> MerkleTree;
    fn verify_transaction(&self, proof: &MerkleProof) -> Result<bool>;
}
```

## Test Infrastructure

    transaction_generator: TransactionGenerator,
}

pub struct LoadTestFramework {
    concurrent_users: usize,
    transaction_rate: u32,
    test_duration: Duration,
}
```
