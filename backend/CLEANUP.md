# Backend Cleanup Implementation History

This document tracks the cleanup and restructuring of the backend, which has now been completed. It progressed through three phases:

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment

Initial issues identified:
- Mixed responsibilities in services
- Tight coupling between components
- Manual dependency management
- Basic error handling
- Insufficient testing
- Security concerns mixed with business logic

## Phase 2: Focused Requirements

Core functionality refined to:
- QR code scanning for property transfers
- Role-based property book visibility (Officers, NCOs, Soldiers)
- Blockchain-verified transactions
- Fast transfer validation

## Phase 3: Final Implementation ✓

The following structure has been implemented:
